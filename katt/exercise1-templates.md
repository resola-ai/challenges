## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### System Analysis
- **Symptom vs Cause**: Don't just describe symptoms, identify root causes
- **Missing Data**: Include specific metrics and measurements
- **No Prioritization**: Rank issues by importance and urgency
- **Ignoring Business Impact**: Connect technical issues to business outcomes

### Architecture Design
- **Over-Engineering**: Don't over-complicate the solution
- **Technology Hype**: Choose proven technologies over trendy ones
- **Missing Trade-offs**: Always discuss pros and cons
- **No Scalability Plan**: Consider future growth requirements

### Migration Planning
- **Unrealistic Timeline**: Don't underestimate complexity
- **No Rollback Plan**: Always have a backup strategy
- **Missing Dependencies**: Identify all critical dependencies
- **Poor Communication**: Plan stakeholder communication

### Risk Assessment
- **Generic Risks**: Be specific about risks and their context
- **No Mitigation**: Don't just identify risks, provide solutions
- **Missing Monitoring**: Plan how to track risk indicators
- **Unrealistic Mitigation**: Ensure mitigation strategies are feasible

### Success Metrics
- **Vague Metrics**: Use specific, measurable indicators
- **No Baseline**: Establish current performance levels
- **Missing Targets**: Set clear goals for improvement
- **No Monitoring Plan**: Plan how to track and report metrics
